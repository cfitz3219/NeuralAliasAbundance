# 2026-10-23 — Phase 1 build contributions pushed

Claude accepted the work split in COMMS; MASTER-PLAN is active. A1 implementation
is on `astra/a1-cpu-regressions` (`acb29e9`): seven portable CTests / 32 cases pass
in GCC Release. Six additional actual host framing/loss cases await Windows/MSVC
CPU CI. A1 is not yet accepted as cross-platform validated. A2 specification is
on `astra/a2-discovery-contract` (`c2dff24`), including A2-R01/R02/R03 requirements
for C7/C8/C9. Frozen interfaces and production code remain untouched.

GitHub API calls return Forbidden here, so PR creation is pending; Claude has
been asked through COMMS to create the PRs from the pushed branches. No early
peer review or merging is requested. Gate 1 review and Windows validation remain
outstanding before Phase 2 integration. Read COMMS for current coordination;
older handoffs below retain their original historical qualifications.

# 2026-10-23 — Recovery review; Claude acknowledgment pending

Claude's recovered baseline `4a4a1ed` contains all 74 exported source/shader files
plus restored dependencies and DXGI exports. Codex independently verified source
agreement modulo line endings/boundary whitespace. Current gaps: 18 missing
test/fixture/stub sources, one optional tool, 17 implementations absent from
CMake, and missing Route B files. Two portable core modules compile on Linux;
the full Windows build, original tests and game behavior remain unverified.

Read [the Claude handoff](docs/CLAUDE-HANDOFF.md),
[acquisition roadmap](docs/INPUT-ACQUISITION-ROADMAP.md), and
[Route B journal](WORKLOG-ROUTE-B.md). Restore a reproducible build before adding
features. R-001 documents a timestamp completion issue for Claude's host review.
The work split is proposed pending Claude's reply. Current user scope is recovery,
review and coordination; old pauses and deployment permissions below are history.
No source implementations or frozen interfaces were changed in this review.

# Collaboration pause - Route B assigned to Astra

User explicitly paused implementation and requested acknowledgment of `../COLLABORATION.md`, target selection and status-board update only. Agreement read and board updated. Astra owns Route B in `src/providers/discovery/` and agreed siblings; Claude owns NGX interception and `src/host_dx12/`. Core/tests and old evaluator/bridge interfaces are frozen pending logged proposal and acknowledgment. Anno 1800 remains the user's chosen Route B target. No GPU/game session authorized by this acknowledgment.

Repository root was not a Git repository at the check; Claude will initialize and commit baseline. Do not initialize or switch the shared checkout. Proposed separate worktrees for route branches to permit safe parallel work; await acknowledgment. No implementation resumes until user says proceed. Next: Route B discovery records/diagnostic plan and required host callbacks, coordinated with Claude. Previous successful build.ps1 ran all eight tests; further provenance/repository checks were interrupted by the user's pause and are not claimed complete.

# Milestone 1 - standalone DX12 foundation

User approved proceeding with a separate DX12 framework targeting games both with and without DLSS. Frame Generation placeholder required. During work, user selected Anno1800 (no nativeDLSS) as first integration target. Original Alien project/install untouched.

Implemented: independent x64 CMake project; byte-exact copies of three reusable core utilities and tests with SHA256 provenance; independent reference copy of prior full source-review archive; two-route frame metadata contract and backend readiness gates; native Windows settings preview including disabledFG; hardware capability report; controlled DX12 compute scene writing clean color/depth/motion/separateHUD; limited systemDXGI forwarding DLL and actualdevice/swapchain/resize test. No third-party package installation, SDK/runtime copy or ReShade dependency.

Release /W4 /WX build passed, all8CTests passed. Hardware scene checked379460pixels across8frames/twoextents; DX12 debug layer enabled with no warnings/errors. GPU evidence in build/evidence; CTest results in build/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log. Manager sees RTX5070Ti and IntelUHD770. Settings test is a hidden programmatic control-state check, not visual QA. Proxy tested via explicitLoadLibrary, not game deployment.

Current UI is a preview, not persistent configuration or in-gameoverlay. Both providers are contract/selection logic, not completed game-data acquisition. No DLAA/SR/NR/FG evaluation is connected to this host. Fixture is layered analytic compute imagery, not full3D renderer. Offline GPU waits/readbacks never belong in live callbacks. Proxy forwards only listed exports and stays namedNeuralAliasDXGI.dll; do not install asdxgi.dll yet.

Anno read-only audit: x64 PE; Steam916440build16367353; configuredDX12; FSRUpscaling0; DXGI factory imports; no staticNGXmatch, which does not exclude dynamicloading. Executable hash and qualification boundaries in docs/ANNO-1800.md. Game closed at inspection. Need resource/command-list observation with lifecycle tracking and fixture verification before diagnostics-only real-game deployment. No need to ask user to repeat title selection or approve already authorized local project development.

Read WORKLOG and docs/PROVENANCE before continuing. Old broader DX11 proposal is historical; current project is DX12first. Do not promise all-game enhancement or reuse earlier narrow20-50hourNRprototype estimate for Anno's adapter discovery.
